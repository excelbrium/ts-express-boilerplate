# TS - Express - Starter
## What's this?
This is just a simple starter which adds express and its corresponding types on top of a basic tsdx project.
Visit [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx) for more information, it's awesome!

The scripts within the package.json are the default ones, provided with tsdx.

### `npm run start` or `yarn start` 
Runs the project in development/watch mode.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Bundles the package to the `dist` folder using Rollup.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`
Runs your tests.

## Usage
Fork or clone if you like. Feel free to delete .git afterwards and use this as the base for your own project.

## Trouble Shooting
### `yarn test` seems to freeze
If you have watchman installed, uninstall it, and jest will automagically work again.
